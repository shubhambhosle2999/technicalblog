        As the demand for faster and more efficient high-performance computers increases,<br>
         the dimensions of the form factors that contain them continue to decrease.<br><br>
        
        For years now, computer engineers have been assigned the challenging task of<br>
         incorporating increasingly powerful computers into and onto increasingly smaller<br>
          chassis and printed circuit boards (PCBs), mainly to satisfy a growing demand for<br>
           more reliable, affordable, size-conscious, energy-efficient, and cost-effective computer systems.<br><br>
        
        It's why we continue to see boundary-pushing size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C)<br>
         developments within the world of embedded systems.<br><br>
        
        In this blog post, we're diving into that very world.<br><br>
        
        We'll talk about the basics of embedded systems, how they're classified, how they<br>
         work, how they compare to servers and workstations, and why you should consider a<br>
          Trenton embedded computer for your next mission-critical deployment.<br><br></p>

        <h1>What Are Embedded System?</h1>
        <p>Embedded systems, also known as embedded computers, are small-form-factor<br>
             computers that power specific tasks. They may function as standalone devices or as<br>
              part of larger systems, hence the term "embedded," and are often used in applications <br>
              with size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) constraints.<br><br>

            Like most computers, embedded systems are a combination of hardware and software, usually:<br></p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Microprocessors or microcontrollers</li>
                    <li>   Graphics processing units (GPUs)</li>
                        <li>   Volatile and non-volatile memory</li>
                            <li>   Input/output communication interfaces and ports</li>
                                <li>    System and application code</li>
                                    <li>    Power supplies</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>But there are four main differentiating factors between an embedded system and a <br>
                typical workstation or server. They are:<br>

            </p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Purpose</li>
                    <li>    Design</li>
                        <li>   Cost</li>
                            <li>  Human involvement</li><br>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <P>There are also advantages and disadvantages to using embedded systems, so<br>
                 whether an embedded system is right for you will depend on the requirements of<br>
                  your program or application. We'll later discuss the pros and cons of embedded<br>
                   systems and how you can decide whether they're suitable for you.<br><br>

                Now that we know the definition of embedded systems, let's discuss the different types.<br></P>
                <br>

                <h1>What are the different types of embedded systems? 
                </h1>
                <br>
                <p>Embedded systems are classified based on performance and functional<br>
                     requirements, as well as the performance of microcontrollers. These classifications can<br>
                      be further divided into categories and subcategories.<br>,<br>

                    When classifying embedded systems based on performance and functional <br>
                    requirements, embedded systems are divided into four categories:<br><br>
                  <ol>
                   <li> Real-time embedded systems</li>
                   <li> Standalone embedded systems</li>
                   <li>  Network, or networked, embedded systems</li>
                   <li>   Mobile embedded systems</li>
                   
                  </ol>  
                </p>
